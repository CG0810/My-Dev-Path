                <h3>Brother's Wedding</h3>
                    <p>My brother is getting married this Saturday, and it's the most important family event of the year so far. This June 14th, we'll gather to celebrate the wonderful union of my sister-in-law and brother through the church. We hope everything goes well and we can enjoy such a beautiful moment in peace and quiet.</p>

                <h3>San Pedrito</h3>
                <p>This Saturday we'll also be celebrating San Pedrito in the residential area where I live, and this is a traditional festival in the department where I live. They're folk festivals that don't really catch my attention, but most people in the area enjoy them quite a bit, in exaggerated ways.</p>
